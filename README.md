AutoScroll
==========

jQuery plugin to scroll overflowing elements based on mouse position


AutoScroll is an incredibly small and simple JQuery plugin that allows overflowing elements with lists scrollable based on the vertical mouse position within that element. One simply needs to attach the plugin to the container element and pass it a JQuery selector for its child list elements.
